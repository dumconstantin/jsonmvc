- Add performance break points for Model.performance() or other segmentation utils
- Create a Chrome Dev Tool for the visual segmentation and performance debugging
- Create a refresh strategy for Model dynamic nodes so that
  continuous development on a single node can occur without state refresh
- Keep ui data in both original and parsed form according to the JSON Schema
- Augment the path system with additional properties: e.g: "/foo/bar:nth(n - 1)" to get the previous
  value from /foo/bar. "/foo/bar:has('a')". node("/foo/bar:contains("foo")", transform)
  This is very similar to CSS selectors and can add a lot of value to the json system.

- The dynamic node computation algorithm has the following gist:
  Each essential data has determined characteristics and validation functions
  that the dynamic node can use when mapping onto the json path in order to
  further reduce the likelihood for the transformation to be triggered.

  node([{
    path: "/foo/bar",
    on: {
      prop: ['completed', false]
    },
    filter: {
      contains: 'text',
      length: '>0'
    }
  }], {
    fn: reducerF,
    characteristics: {
      string: ['length', /regex/]
    }
  })


  [
    /foo, -> return prevFoo.length === foo.length ? false : true
  ]

  node("/foo/bar:ignore(length=0)", reducerF)

- The first line of defence to avoid unnecessary recalculation is to enable caching of
  values between transformations so that a transformation is only triggered if the dynamic
  node its listening to outputs a different value

- Add indexes similar to firebase so that transactions linking with ids are possbile

- Simply state update logic:
db.data({
  foo: '/bar/baz',
  bam: '/bam/bam'
}).onValue(data => {
  self.data = data
  self.update()
})

where ``` db.data ``` will return a stream of data changes that gives the same data plus the new changes.
In turn each data property will listen to the database updates.
The database will support batch updates like these to avoid individual listeners.
By having a batch update setup we give a declarative way of describing the full data set required for
a component to function - this way powerfull optimisations are possible plus a enhanced control.

- Adding a transformation of data in the view is a very bad idea. E.g.

View.data(this, {
  foo: ['/foo/bar', length]
})

This way the view is inconsistent with the data structure, if a data transformation is needed then
a dynamic node should be created on the data tree. In order to ensure this, all data declaration
should happen outside the View module or statically inside it.

Dynamic nodes are of three cathegories: alterating, combinating and mixed.
Based on the type of dynamic node optimisations can be performed - combinating can cache
the past values and only apply the new value, alterating can cache the context
while mixed cannot be predicted.

At compilation the dynamic nodes are parsed and a new code is generated that is optimal
similar to how Emscriptem will take C code and generate JavaScript code.
A help in this regard will be using a standard library for declaring transformations.

Another optimisation is using tests declaration afferent to the dynamic node in order
to generate subsequent better code optimised for processing.

A sample interface:

---- Model ----

import { db } from 'jsonmvc'

{
  foo: {
    bar: db.on(['/bam', '/baz'], (bam, baz) => {

    })
  }
}

--- View ---
<div data-bind="{
  foo: '/bar/baz',
  bam: '/bar/bam',
  boo: '/boo/bam'
}">
  <h1>{ data.foo }</h1>
  <h2>{ data.bam }</h2>

  <ul data-each="/foo/bam">
    <li>{ foo } is for { data.foo }</li>
  </ul>

  <div data-bind="{
    foo: '/boo/baa'
  }">
    { data.foo }
  </div>

</div>

'#foo': {
  bam: '/bar/bam',
  baz: '/boo/ba'
}
