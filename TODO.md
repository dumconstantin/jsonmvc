- Add performance break points for Model.performance() or other segmentation utils
- Create a Chrome Dev Tool for the visual segmentation and performance debugging
- Create a refresh strategy for Model dynamic nodes so that
  continuous development on a single node can occur without state refresh
- Keep ui data in both original and parsed form according to the JSON Schema
- Augment the path system with additional properties: e.g: "/foo/bar:nth(n - 1)" to get the previous
  value from /foo/bar. "/foo/bar:has('a')". node("/foo/bar:contains("foo")", transform)
  This is very similar to CSS selectors and can add a lot of value to the json system.

- The dynamic node computation algorithm has the following gist:
  Each essential data has determined characteristics and validation functions
  that the dynamic node can use when mapping onto the json path in order to
  further reduce the likelihood for the transformation to be triggered.

  node([{
    path: "/foo/bar",
    on: {
      prop: ['completed', false]
    },
    filter: {
      contains: 'text',
      length: '>0'
    }
  }], {
    fn: reducerF,
    characteristics: {
      string: ['length', /regex/]
    }
  })

  node("/foo/bar:ignore(length=0)", reducerF)

- The first line of defence to avoid unnecessary recalculation is to enable caching of
  values between transformations so that a transformation is only triggered if the dynamic
  node its listening to outputs a different value
